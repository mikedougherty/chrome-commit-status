Colors SHAs on GitHub with their commit status.

As far as I know, there's only one place to view the CI status of a commit on github - in the pull request view. This is unfortunate, so I've created this extension to color commit IDs according to their status.

Notes:
 * Everything is very rudimentary- literally the very least amount I could do to get this in a working state. Forks & pull requests welcome!
 * I don't know if this will work on private repositories when logged in; I assume the user's cookies take effect when making the API request.
 * Supports enterprise (this is in fact my primary use case), but needs permission for all websites for this to work
